# SMSGateway.me Client for API v4
Recently the implementation of the smsgateway.me for sending/receiving SMS's has changed
and broke the library that I was using, so I decided to make my own version

# Usage
## Installation
`pip install smsgateway-v4`

## Token
Get your API Token in the [settings page](https://smsgateway.me/dashboard/settings)

## Client initalization
Before starting is necessary to create the client with the token as parameter
```
from smsgateway import SMSGateway, Message
client = SMSGateway('your-api-token-here-keep-it-secret')
```

## Device lookup
Sending messages requires the device id, so its necessary to get it
```
devices = client.search_devices()
if len(devices['results']) == 0:
  raise Exception('No device found on your account')
  
did = devices['results'][0]['id']
```
> Its possible to pass a filter object as parameter as [specified on the docs](https://smsgateway.me/sms-api-documentation/devices/searching-android-devices)

## Sending messages
```
message1 = Message('12345678', 'Message 1 body', did)
message2 = Message('12345678', 'Message 2 body', did)
status = client.send_sms(message1, message2)
print(status)
```
